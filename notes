When you use position absolute in styles, it shrinks the view to min required size to display that view in screen.

Using stlye prop {left, right} with Animation in RN conflicts each other.

When we keep Animated.View inside View, the device re-renders everything. So if there is an image from internet inside 
Animated.View, the device goes to internet again and fetches it.

We dont have to use .bind(this) when the function is fat arrow function. It implicitly handles that.

async/await is a good refactoring for .then(). 
  () => { a.then b } is equivalent to async () => { await a; await b; }.
 To handle .catch(), we can use traditional try ... catch statements.
